# Calculator

### A Javascript project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

The task was to create an interactive calculator that can perform basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /) one operation at a time. 
Incorporating decimal numbers was presented as an optional feature for extra challenge. 

I decided to add decimal numbers as well as exponent and square root functions. 
I also implemented a **calculation log** that displays the last 4 operations as an extra challenge for myself. 

My design aesthetic was largely based off the native calculator for Ubuntu Linux.
